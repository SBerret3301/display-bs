Explanation:

1. **Title Modification:**
   - The title of the document is changed to "Display Headings in Bootstrap."

2. **Bootstrap CSS:**
   - The `<link>` tag is included to link the Bootstrap CSS file (`bootstrap.css`).

3. **Comments:**
   - Comments are added to the code for better understanding of each section, Bootstrap classes used, and their purposes.

Note: Make sure that the path to your Bootstrap CSS file is correct (`href="bootstrap.css"`) and that the Bootstrap library is properly linked. If it's not in the same directory, provide the correct path.
